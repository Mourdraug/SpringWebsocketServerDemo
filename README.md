# SpringWebsocketServerDemo
Simple Springboot application configured to work with frontend through websocket using authorization and csrf token protection.

I tried to explain the way it works in comments, I'll try to write more in-depth tutorial later.

Use Maven for building. 
If you only want to run it use `mvn spring-boot:run`.
You can also pack jar file with `mvn package` and run it with `java -jar <jar_path>`
